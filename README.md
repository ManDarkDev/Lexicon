# Lexicon
A source of knowledge for all things that encompass Bitcoin with an emphasis on Bitcoin Mining. 
Over the course of 4+ years working within the Bitcoin Mining Inudstry, there seems to be a lack of a central source of information specifically for Bitcoin Mining. 
There are evangelists and orators and book writers that speak well on the economics and social dynamics of bitcoin, but we need a better source of Truth for technical Bitcoin Mining terminology.
Insert 'The Lexicon'
This is the first of many versions of The Bitcoin Lexicon. There may be terms missing. 
I invite you to download and retrofit this Lexicon. 
Being that Bitcoin is a multidisciplinarian subject, it is practical to have experts from different fields contribute to the lexicon. 
If a person wanted to learn more about Bitcoin mining terms and phrases, this is a great place to start!
