# Lexicon
A source of knowledge for all things that encompass Bitcoin with an emphasis on Bitcoin Mining. 
Over the course of 3 years, there seems to be a lack of a central source of information for Bitcoin Mining. 
There are evangelists and orators and book writers, but we need a better source of Truth for Bitcoin Mining terminology.
This is the first of many versions of The Bitcoin Lexicon. There may be terms missing. 
I invite you to download and retrofit this Lexicon. 
Being that Bitcoin is a multidisciplinarian subject, it is practical to have experts from different fields contribute to the lexicon. 
If a person wanted to learn more about Bitcoin mining terms and phrases, this is a great place to start!
