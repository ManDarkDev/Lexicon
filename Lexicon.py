#Dictionaries are a built-in data type that store key-value pairs. 
#They are unordered, mutable, and indexed by keys, which can be of any immutable type (like strings, numbers, or tuples)
#You can give them order though

#Explanation:
#BitcoinTerminology Dictionary: This dictionary contains the keywords and their corresponding definitions.
#Input Loop: The script enters a loop that prompts the user to input a keyword.
#'all' Keyword: If the user types all, the script will display all keywords and their definitions.
#'exit' Keyword: Typing exit will stop the program.
#Keyword Search: If the input matches a keyword in the dictionary, the script will display the corresponding definition. If the keyword is not found, it will prompt the user to try again.
#You can run this script in any Python environment to test it out!
