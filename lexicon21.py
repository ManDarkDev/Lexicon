    "3p" : "3 Phase Electricity - Three-phase electricity is a type of electrical power distribution that uses three alternating currents, each phase offset by one-third of the cycle to provide a continuous flow of energy",
    "1p" : "Single Phase Electricity - One-phase electricity, or single-phase power, involves a single alternating current that delivers electric power in a unidirectional flow, typically used in residential properties.",
    "satoshi": "Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonymous person or group who developed Bitcoin, authored its original white paper, and designed and launched the first version of the Bitcoin software",
    "sat": "Sat - A satoshi, often abbreviated as sat, is the smallest unit of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, named after its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. One satoshi is equal to one hundred millionth of a single Bitcoin, or 0.00000001 BTC",
    "acdc": "Alternating Current to Direct Current - In a Bitcoin mining PSU, alternating current (AC) from the power grid is converted to direct current (DC) to supply the stable and continuous power required by the mining hardware. This conversion is essential because the mining machines' components, like ASIC chips, operate on DC power for efficient and consistent performance",
    "heatdiss": "Heat Dissipation - Heat dissipation from the exhaust at air-cooled Bitcoin mining facilities involves releasing the excess heat generated by mining hardware into the environment. Various methods to utilize this heat include redirecting it for residential or industrial heating, greenhouse farming, or even in sustainable energy projects to improve overall energy efficiency",
    "ppa": "Power Purchase Agreement - an arrangement in which a third-party developer installs, owns, and operates an energy system on a customer’s property. The customer then purchases the system's electric output for a predetermined period. A PPA allows the customer to receive stable and often low-cost electricity with no upfront cost, while also enabling the owner of the system to take advantage of tax credits and receive income from the sale of electricity. Though most commonly used for renewable energy systems, PPAs can also be applied to other energy technologies such as combined heat and power (CHP).",
